* I Wrote a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file (CHECKING Preprocessor understandin
g).                                                                                                                                     
* I Wrote a script that compiles a C file but does not link (CHECKING Compiler understanding).                                          
* I Wrote a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file (CHECKING Assembler Understanding).      
* I Wrote a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.                                                       
* I wrote C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle:                                            
** I Used the function puts and not printf. (CHECKING Puts Understamding)                                                               
* I wrote a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art:                                       
** I used the function printf and not puts. (CHWCKING Printf Understanding)                                                             
* I wrote a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.                                  
* I wrote a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.                           
* I wrote a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the sta
